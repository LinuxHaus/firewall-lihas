If the iptables module 'comment' is available, rule generation logs the
IDs of the used files as a comment on each generated rule.
The ID<->file information is stored in a database in db_dbd, configured
via config.xml. By default this is /var/lib/firewall-lihas/db.sqlite.
To get a full list use:
  sqlite3 /var/lib/firewall-lihas/db.sqlite "SELECT * FROM fw_comments"
